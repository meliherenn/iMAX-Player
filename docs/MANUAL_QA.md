# Manual QA checklist

These checks require an Android phone, Android TV/emulator, or installed release artifact. They were
not executed in the repository-only hardening environment.

Use synthetic, owned, or otherwise authorized test playlists and streams. Never attach production
credentials to bug reports or screenshots.

## Android phone

- Install the debug build on API 26, API 31, API 33, and API 35+ where available.
- Verify a fresh install opens onboarding and does not request broad photo/video storage access.
- Add an M3U URL, Xtream account, and local M3U document through the system picker.
- Force-stop/relaunch after local document import and verify persisted URI access still works.
- Verify invalid URL, wrong credentials, empty playlist, timeout, and offline states are readable and
  do not crash or reveal a password.
- Confirm active playlist persistence, edit/delete behavior, counts, categories, search, favorites,
  history clearing, empty states, and loading states.
- Verify portrait, landscape, split-screen, display-size changes, font scaling, and edge-to-edge
  insets on gesture and three-button navigation.
- Play live HLS/TS and owned VOD samples with Media3; repeat with LibVLC.
- Switch engines while buffering, playing, paused, and after an error. Confirm live restarts from the
  live edge and VOD resumes near its prior position.
- Exercise pause/resume, seek limits, double-tap seek, volume/brightness gestures, screen lock,
  aspect modes, playback speeds, video quality, audio tracks, subtitles, and subtitle disable.
- Rotate during playback and after opening each player sheet. Verify no duplicate audio or leaked
  player surface.
- Press Home during playback on Android 8-11 and Android 12+. Verify PiP transition, 16:9 bounds,
  hidden overlays, resume to full screen, and correct teardown after closing PiP.
- Disconnect/reconnect Wi-Fi during live playback. Verify bounded retries and a usable final error.
- Test audio-only, video-only, malformed, HTTP 401/403/404/5xx, codec failure, and ended media.
- Verify parental PIN setup, five-failure lockout, successful unlock, category filtering, PIN change,
  and clearing.
- Verify Turkish, English, and system locale changes after process restart.
- Run TalkBack through actionable controls and confirm meaningful labels and logical traversal.

## Android TV

- Install on at least one Google TV/Android TV device and one TV emulator/API level if available.
- Confirm the Leanback launcher banner, app label, splash screen, and TV UI selection.
- Complete onboarding with only a D-pad: first focus, add source, type selection, fields, test, save,
  cancel, edit, delete, and focus recovery after every dialog.
- If remote setup is configured, verify the locally rendered QR, eight-character pairing code,
  success, timeout, cancel, invalid code, oversized file, and backend-unavailable states.
- Navigate every top-level destination using Up/Down/Left/Right/Center/Back. Look for focus traps,
  invisible focus, lost focus after list updates, unexpected drawer opening, or off-screen focus.
- Stress long category/channel/movie/series lists and rapid D-pad input. Verify stable card sizes,
  scrolling, retained selection, and no large frame stalls.
- Open search, invoke the TV keyboard, clear/query/filter results, open details, return, and confirm
  predictable focus restoration.
- Verify all text is readable at typical 2-4 meter distance and at 720p, 1080p, and 4K output.
- Play live and VOD with both engines. Verify black-frame handling, first-frame confirmation,
  buffering/error overlays, track dialogs, quality/aspect/speed dialogs, and sleep timer.
- Exercise Back, Center, arrows, channel Up/Down, numeric channel entry, Play/Pause, Fast Forward,
  Rewind, and any device-specific media keys.
- Switch channels quickly and queue another switch while the first is warming up. Confirm failure
  returns to a playable state and never leaves two audio streams running.
- Open/close channel and category panels repeatedly; verify first focus and focus recovery.
- Suspend/wake the TV, switch HDMI/input, background/foreground the app, and force-stop/relaunch.
- Check overscan/safe areas and ensure no essential control sits under system UI.

## Release APK/AAB

- Build from a clean checkout with the intended `version.properties` and JDK 17.
- Inspect signing certificate and confirm it matches the previous production certificate.
- Install release over the previous production version and verify data/migration retention.
- Verify `release`/Play artifacts contain no `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission or update
  `FileProvider`; verify `selfHostedRelease` contains them only when direct distribution is intended.
- Run `apkanalyzer manifest permissions`, `apkanalyzer manifest print`, or equivalent against the
  exact upload artifact.
- Verify minification does not break Hilt, Room, Retrofit serialization, Media3, LibVLC, metadata,
  or worker creation.
- Test offline cold start, process death, low-storage download/import, and low-memory backgrounding.
- Confirm no debug logs, test endpoints, sample accounts, real streams, keys, keystores, or local
  paths are packaged.
- For self-hosted update only: verify HTTPS manifest, version comparison, mandatory/optional UI,
  SHA-256 rejection, oversized APK rejection, unknown-sources flow, signature continuity, and retry.

## Play Console and sensitive permissions

- Upload only the Play-oriented `release` AAB, never `selfHostedRelease`.
- Confirm Play's App bundle explorer does not list `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`, storage/media read,
  or media-playback foreground-service-type permissions from app code.
- Review the final merged `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` permission added by WorkManager and confirm there is
  no app-declared long-running playback foreground service.
- Complete Data safety based on the exact distribution configuration, including optional TMDB or
  remote-setup network processing.
- Supply a privacy-policy URL and verify its claims match the build.
- Review cleartext traffic, TV screenshot/banner requirements, content rating, target audience,
  ads declaration, app access instructions, and intellectual-property declarations.
- Recheck current target API and restricted-permission policy immediately before submission.
